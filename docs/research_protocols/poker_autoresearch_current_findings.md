Date: 2026-05-10

## Incumbent

- Checkpoint: `models/slumbot_2p_iter1000.pt`
- Iteration: 1000
- Shape: 4 layers, hidden dim 512
- Track: heads-up, full-deck, Slumbot-stack training

## Completed Gates

- `tier0`: passed legal-mask, network-mask, and Slumbot mapping tests.
- `eval-local`: passed 32-game fixed-seed local random-opponent smoke.
- `eval-local-confidence`: passed 1,000-game local random-opponent baseline.
- `eval-local-multiseed`: passed 3 seeds x 1,000 games.
- `eval-incumbent-self-compare`: passed incumbent-vs-itself comparison and
  emitted non-promotable local comparison blockers.
- `eval-head-to-head-self-compare`: passed duplicate-swapped model-vs-model
  self-comparison.
- `slumbot-smoke`: passed live API integration with solver/all-in disabled.
- `slumbot-solver-smoke`: passed live API integration with turn/river solver
  enabled and all-in disabled.

## Metric Snapshot

Local random baseline:

- 3,000 total local games across three seeds.
- Average: `+319.23` chips/hand.
- Lower 95% across seeds: `+233.72` chips/hand.

Live Slumbot diagnostic smokes:

- No-solver, no-all-in, 5 hands: `-80` chips/hand.
- Solver enabled, no-all-in, 10 hands: `-443` chips/hand.
- Solver smoke runtime: `84.98` seconds for 10 hands.
- Runtime-metric no-solver smoke: `-308` chips/hand over 5 hands,
  `3.669` elapsed seconds, `0.734` seconds/hand.

Local incumbent comparison:

- Incumbent self-compare: `0.0` delta chips/hand over 3 seeds x 500 games.
- Promotion status: `promotable=false`.
- Promotion blockers: `local_random_comparison_is_not_strategy_quality`,
  `requires_incumbent_or_slumbot_confidence_gate`.

Local head-to-head self-comparison:

- Duplicate-swapped self-compare: `0.0` chips/hand over 1,200 local games
  (3 seeds x 200 duplicate pairs).
- Promotion status: `promotable=false`.
- Promotion blocker: `local_head_to_head_requires_slumbot_confirmation`.

## Diagnosis

Primary failure class: `distribution_shift`.

The current model is not validated by random-opponent local wins. The local
random baseline is positive, but Slumbot smokes are negative even with the
diagnostic no-all-in setting. Five to ten hands are not statistically strong,
but they are enough to show that the live evaluation path is working and that
random-opponent performance is too weak as the main promotion metric.

Secondary failure class: `search_quality`.

The solver-enabled smoke took about 8.5 seconds per hand at the current 10-hand
setting. This is acceptable for a diagnostic smoke but too slow to use casually
inside every unattended iteration. Slumbot search needs separate latency,
cache, and quality gates.

## Next Workflow Moves

1. Use Slumbot only for sparse live checks until the local incumbent-comparison
   path and promotion blockers are stable.
2. Candidate checkpoint comparisons are now queueable with
   `python scripts/poker_autoresearch.py enqueue-compare --candidate <path>`.
   Use `--head-to-head` for the stronger duplicate-swapped model-vs-model gate.
3. Investigate why no-solver and solver Slumbot smokes remain negative despite
   strong local-random metrics.
